EDA


1. What is the goal of EDA (exploratory data analysis)?
- The goal of EDA is to get to a manageable data set that is free of errors.  The other goal is to understand this data set and get ideas of what truths or observations can be revealed with modeling.


2. Suppose that you are given a dataset of customer product reviews for an e-commerce company. Each review is scored as a Likert-style survey item where 1 indicates a negative sentiment about the product and a 5 is positive. These reviews are collected on the company's website. 

a. What problems do you expect to find in the raw data? 
- There are several issues with the original data.  There may be fraudulent entries either from the company driving up review score or competition hurting a product.  Since the data is self-reported, there may also be varying understanding or standard per individual.  The 1-5 scale may also be confused with a 1-10 scale.

b. If your task is to build features that give information about customer sentiments, how would you approach this task and what kind of methods would you apply to accomplish it? 
- Features: PRODUCTID, CUSTOMERID, CUSTOMER_REGION, SCORE, PRICE, DATE_PURCHASED, DATE_REVIEWED.  PRODUCTID is unique to each product and model sold by the company.  CUSTOMERID is unique to registered customers with a default value (eg 00000) for guest checkout.  CUSTOMER_REGION, if possible, is location of customer based on their ip address; this allows some information on guest checkout.  SCORE is the review score tied to unique combination of PRODUCTID and CUSTOMERID; where no review is provided, enter as null. PRICE varies with combination of PRODUCTID and DATE_PURCHASED.  DATE_PURCHASED is datetime at completion of order.  DATE_REVIEWED is either datetime at submission of review or days elapsed between purchase and review.   

c. Try to identify some potentially useful features that you might derive from the raw data. How would you derive them and how would you assess the usefulness of those features?
- Average SCORE or frequency of each score for each unique PRODUCTID, CUSTOMERID, CUSTOMER_REGION, and DATE_REVIEWED; this can show if there's a trend in these columns.  Sum the PRICE for unique PRODUCTID to learn which product is generating most revenue, and compare with average score if there is correlation.  Find CUSTOMERID info on sum(PRICE)), len(SCORE), max(SCORE), and min(SCORE) to target customers with promotions depending on company strategy.
