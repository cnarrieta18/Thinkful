EDA


1. What is the goal of EDA (exploratory data analysis)?
- The goal of EDA is to get to a manageable data set that is free of errors.  The other goal is to understand this data set and get ideas of what truths or observations can be revealed with modeling.


2. Suppose that you are given a dataset of customer product reviews for an e-commerce company. Each review is scored as a Likert-style survey item where 1 indicates a negative sentiment about the product and a 5 is positive. These reviews are collected on the company's website. 

a. What problems do you expect to find in the raw data? 
- There are several issues with the original data.  There may be fraudulent entries either from the company driving up review score or competition hurting a product.  Since the data is self-reported, there may also be varying understanding or standard per individual.  The 1-5 scale may also be confused with a 1-10 scale.

b. If your task is to build features that give information about customer sentiments, how would you approach this task and what kind of methods would you apply to accomplish it? 
- We can get overall average score for each product; or get frequency of each scores; or sum the sentiments for each product 

c. Try to identify some potentially useful features that you might derive from the raw data. How would you derive them and how would you assess the usefulness of those features?
