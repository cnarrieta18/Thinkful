1. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of treating the Rank variable as categorical. Discuss your arguments with your mentor.  -Categorical does not measure distance, which seems appropriate since the top channel does not necessarily mean twice as popular as the top 2 channel.  Disadvantage is treating 5000 unique entries as categories.

2. What are the types of the following variables?
        Age: can be (ratio?) continuous or ordinal categorical
        Salary: can be ratio continuous or ordinal categorical
        Revenue: can be ratio continuous or ordinal categorical
        Customer type: nominal categorical
        Stock price: interval continuous or ordinal categorical
