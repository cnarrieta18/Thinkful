I am interested in taking it along with the data science course to build domain knowledge and build my projects around the topic of real estate invesment.  It starts this Wednesday and they are still accepting enrollment.  The class is only 7-10 hours per week so I should be able to squeeze it in, I think.  Curious if you have thoughts on this."
